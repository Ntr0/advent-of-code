# Advend of Code 2022 - Day 8 - Typescript

So I'm not very familiar with the Node.js/Typescript ecosystem. Just installed everything (typescript, ts-node, 
jest, ts-jest, @types/jest, ...) to run unit tests and solved the thing. I guess there will be a way to
install deps using the package.json, so good luck :)
