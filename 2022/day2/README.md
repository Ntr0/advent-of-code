# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 2 - Rockstar

I decided to try a very interesting esoteric language: [Rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar).

I heard of this first [here](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U?t=3179) and found it interesting :)

## Make it run
You'll need a rockstar transpiler. I tried rockstar-py first, but it was a waste of time as the transpiler was not 
up-to-date. I had more luck with the excellent Java implementation [rocky](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky).
Just clone the repo and call the binary that is included there directly. Or use the installer if you plan to become
a full-time Rockstar developer.
